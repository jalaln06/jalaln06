## Intro
Hey! 

I'm interested in Quantum Computing(especially QML), LLMs, and Machine Learning on Graphs.
I'm currently working on research in [Using KG with LLMS](https://github.com/ElkinStas/KG_and_LLM)
I'm in the process of learning more about Quantum Computation. 
I'd love to participate in any projects working with QC and QML.
